    Welcome to the Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) Predictor Project homepage! 
 
    Our ASD Predictor application is an innovative tool designed to assist in the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. We understand the importance of early detection and intervention to improve the well-being and quality of life for individuals with ASD.
 
    We have conducted extensive research and analysis to develop a robust prediction model for the public. Our findings are based on comprehensive data analysis, including behavioral characteristics, communication patterns, social interactions, and other relevant factors associated with ASD.

    """
    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects a significant number of individuals, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 54 children in the United States. However, many cases of ASD go undiagnosed until later in life, leading to delayed intervention and support.

    Early detection and diagnosis of ASD in adulthood are crucial for individuals to receive appropriate interventions, therapies, and support services. However, there is a need to improve the identification and prediction of ASD, as it can be challenging to recognize the symptoms and distinguish them from other conditions.
 
    Therefore, our problem statement is how can we use machine learning to help in predicting ASD for early detection.
